## In short

If you want to create a standalone library with filters, directives, services, etc for use in your AngularJS applications, then this generator may just be what you need.

The generator automatically:

- creates a complete directory structure with boilerplate code for your [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) library
- creates a complete directory structure for your tests
- configures [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to build your code and automate testing
- sets up [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) to run your unit tests using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/)

> This generator is **NOT** made to generate complete AngularJS applications. If you want to generate a complete AngularJS web application with routes, views, etc then please use [generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).

## Quick start

Make sure you have [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) installed:

```sh
$ npm install -g yo
```

Install the generator:

```sh
$ npm install -g generator-angularjs-library
```

Create a new project directory:

```sh
$ mkdir sample-project
$ cd sample-project
```

Run:

```sh
$ yo angularjs-library
```

Answer the questions and the generator will create the boilerplate for your library:

## What the generator does for you

The generator automatically:

- creates a `src` directory structure with the boilerplate code for your AngularJS library
- creates a `test` directory structure to store your unit tests and e2e tests
- creates initial unit tests in the `test/unit/` directory
- creates a custom `gulpfile.js` to build, minify and uglify your library
- creates a custom `karma-src.conf.js` to let karma run your unit tests
- creates a custom `karma-dist-concatenated.conf.js` to let karma run your unit tests
- creates a custom `karma-dist-minified.conf.js` to let karma run your unit tests
- creates a custom `bower.json` with necessary devDependencies and appropriate ignore files
- creates a custom `package.json` file for your library
- creates a custom `.travis.yml` file to enable travis support
- creates a custom `.jshintrc` to support angular global during syntax check
- creates a custom `README.md` file
- creates a custom `LICENSE` file

Running the generator using library name "Your Library" will result in the following files being generated for you:

```sh

## How to use the generated boilerplate

The basic library structure is automatically created for you in the `src` folder.

You can edit the existing files or add additional files in the `src` folder to add components to your library.

Once you have added files in the `src` directory, you can update the files in the `dist` directory using:

```sh
$ gulp
```

First gulp will

- check the JavaScript syntax of `src/**/*.js`
- run all unit tests using the code in your `src` directory

to make sure the code is fine.

Then all files in the `src` directory will be concatenated into 2 files in the `dist` directory:

- `<your-library-name>.js`: regular version of your library to use in a development environment
- `<your-library-name>.min.js`: minified version of your library to use in a production environment

![gulp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1859381/5643937/5be842a8-965e-11e4-8189-b2cb272b1d15.gif)

## Manually testing your code

The generator creates 3 configurations for unit testing:

- `karma-src.conf.js`: run unit tests using `src/**/*.js`
- `karma-dist-concatenated.conf.js`: run unit tests using `dist/<your-library-name>.js`
- `karma-dist-minified.conf.js`: run unit tests using `dist/<your-library-name>.min.js`

By default, `gulp` will run `karma-src.conf.js`, but you can use the following preconfigured Gulp tasks to specify the suite you want to run:

```sh
# Run unit tests using src/**/*.js
$ gulp test-src

# Run unit tests using dist/<your-library-name>.js
$ gulp test-dist-concatenated

# Run unit tests using dist/<your-library-name>.min.js
$ gulp test-dist-minified
```

This allows you to unit test the different builds of your code to ensure they all work as expected.

### How to write a test

Suppose you have a service:

```javascript
// src/my-lib/services/some-service.js
angular.module('myLib.services')
  .service('someService', function() {
    this.foo = function() {
      return 1234;
    };
  });
```

Then you write a test like this:

```javascript

describe('someService', function() {

  var someService;

  // load the module
  beforeEach(module('myLib.services'));

  // inject the service
  beforeEach(inject(function(_someService_) {
    someService = _someService_;
  }));
  
  it('should exist', function() {
    expect(someService).to.be.ok;
  });
  
  it('should have a method called foo', function() {
    expect(someService.foo).to.be.a('function');
  });
  
});
```
